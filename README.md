# Basic_Java

This repository contains learning exercises and projects in Java, covering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), console applications, and basic programming concepts.  
Ideal for study and showcasing Java development skills.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. TreeDrawing
- Folder: `tree_drawing/`
- Description: A console-based tree drawing project using Java.  
  Demonstrates OOP concepts, loops, and ANSI color formatting.  
- Main file: `OOPArbol.java`

### 2. Logic and Math Exercises
- **Folder:** `logic_math_math/`  
- **Description:** A collection of Java exercises focused on **loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)**, arithmetic operations, and basic programming logic.  
- **Exercises included:**
  1. **Numbers 1 to 10 (`do-while` loop)** – Print numbers 1 to 10.  
  2. **Series 20, 25, 30 … 80 (`while` loop)** – Print the series increasing by 5.  
  3. **Series 100, 98, 96 … 50 (`for` loop)** – Print the decreasing series by 2.  
  4. **Multiplication 1 to N (`do-while` loop)** – Calculate product of numbers 1 to a random `N` (1–10).  
  5. **Sum of squares 1 to N (`while` loop)** – Sum squares of first `N` natural numbers.  
  6. **Sum of even and odd numbers 1 to N (`for` loop)** – Calculate sums of even and odd numbers separately.
  7. **Command-Line Greeting** – Prints `"Hello FirstName LastName"` using command-line arguments.
  8. **Integer Operations Menu** – Prompts for two integers `(1–10)` and shows a menu to add, subtract, multiply, or divide repeatedly until exit.
  9. **Prints numbers from 1 up to a specified number** in right-aligned columns as requested by the user.
  10. **Linear System Solver (2x2 equations)** – Solves a system of two linear equations with two unknowns using `Cramer's` rule and indicates if the system is solvable.
